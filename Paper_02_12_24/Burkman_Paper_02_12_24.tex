%%%%% Abstract
Some new cell phones can detect the deceleration profile of a car crash and automatically notify emergency services who will immediately send police, but should they also immediately dispatch an ambulance?  Getting medical attention sooner could be life-saving, but most crashes do not require an ambulance.  Using historical data, we build an AI recommendation system to predict which ambulances to immediately dispatch within set budgetary constraints.  Setting those budgetary constraints is a public policy decision, and we consider three options.  We measure the success of the system by its recall, the proportion of needed ambulances that it correctly recommends for immediate dispatch.

The recall depends heavily on the features of the input data.  Does the notification come with only a location, or does the cell service provider also share what it knows about the primary user of the phone, like name, age, and sex?  Can the system instantaneously correlate the name with vehicle registration records to give the make and model of the car likely involved?   We consider three sets of features and show that the recall increases significantly with better information.  

Considering the three sets of features, three metrics, and thirteen models, the best result we achieve is that if we have the full feature set, using the budgetary constraint that we can only afford to increase the number of ambulances sent to crashes with automated notifications by 5\%, the best model correctly recommends immediately dispatching ambulances to 12\% of those who need one.  

We trained the models on the Crash Report Sampling System (CRSS) 2016-2021, a publicly available dataset of 700,000 US crashes.  We have adapted new methods (new for this dataset in the literature) to handle missing data.  To promote discussion and future research, we have posted all of the code we used in our work.

% Research highlights
\begin{highlights}
	\item  Supports transferability and benchmarking of different approaches on a public large-scale dataset.  We have made public (on GitHub) the code we used to perform the analysis on data from the Crash Report Sampling System (CRSS) and all of the output data.  
	\item Novel Application motivated by Emerging Technology:  Machine learning classification models for dispatching ambulances based on automated crash reports from cell phones.  
	\item New Use of Dataset:  We used the Crash Report Sampling System (CRSS), which has imputed missing values for some features, but not for all of the features we wanted to use.  For the first time we have seen, we used the software the CRSS authors use for multiple imputation (IVEware) to impute missing values in more features, then compared the results with other imputation methods.
	\item Explicit Incorporation of Imbalanced Costs:  False Positives give additional cost, False Negatives give delayed medical care.
	\item Explicit Incorporation of Political Dimensions: Framing the decision threshold as a government budget question.
	\item Consideration of Marginal Effects of Threshold Shifting
	\item Perennial Machine Learning Challenge:  Imbalanced Datasets
