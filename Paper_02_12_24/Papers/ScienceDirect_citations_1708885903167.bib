abstract = {Providers of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) face the online ambulance dispatch problem, in which they decide which ambulance to send to an incoming incident. Their objective is to minimize the fraction of arrivals later than a target time. Today, the gap between existing solutions and the optimum is unknown, and we provide a bound for this gap. Motivated by this, we propose a benchmark model (referred to as the offline model) to calculate the optimal dispatch decisions assuming that all incidents are known in advance. For this model, we introduce and implement three different methods to compute the optimal offline dispatch policy for problems with a finite number of incidents. The performance of the offline optimal solution serves as a bound for the performance of an – unknown – optimal online dispatching policy. We show that the competitive ratio (i.e., the worst case performance ratio between the optimal online and the optimal offline solution) of the dispatch problem is infinitely large; that is, even an optimal online dispatch algorithm can perform arbitrarily bad compared to the offline solution. Then, we performed benchmark experiments for a large ambulance provider in the Netherlands. The results show that for this realistic EMS system, when dispatching the closest idle vehicle to every incident, one obtains a fraction of late arrivals that is approximately 2.7 times that of the optimal offline policy. We also analyze another online dispatch heuristic, that manages to reduce this gap to approximately 1.9. This constitutes the first quantification of the gap between online and offline dispatch policies.}

abstract = {Location-allocation of ambulances is a critical planning problem in the efficient operation of an emergency medical services system. This work considers a joint ambulance location and dispatch problem for a multi-tier ambulance system. The proposed problem addresses three key decisions: the location of ambulance stations, allocation of ambulances to these stations, and the preference order of stations for dispatching ambulances. We consider various other important factors, such as temporal variation in demand and travel time, station-specific ambulance busy probabilities and possible relocation of ambulances over the day. A mixed-integer non-linear programming model is formulated with a survival probability-based objective function to represent the problem. A queueing-based iterative approximation approach is presented to estimate the station-level dispatch probability of ambulances. We propose an adaptive variable neighbourhood search approach to solve the problem that utilises the approximation approach to obtain the objective function. A relaxed station location problem combined with a particle swarm approach for ambulance allocation is solved to obtain an initial solution. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated using a dataset generated based on the city of Kolkata in India.}

abstract = {Emergency service providers are supposed to locate ambulances such that in case of emergency patients can be reached in a time-efficient manner. Two fundamental decisions and choices need to be made real-time. First of all immediately after a request emerges an appropriate vehicle needs to be dispatched and send to the requests’ site. After having served a request the vehicle needs to be relocated to its next waiting location. We are going to propose a model and solve the underlying optimization problem using approximate dynamic programming (ADP), an emerging and powerful tool for solving stochastic and dynamic problems typically arising in the field of operations research. Empirical tests based on real data from the city of Vienna indicate that by deviating from the classical dispatching rules the average response time can be decreased from 4.60 to 4.01 minutes, which corresponds to an improvement of 12.89%. Furthermore we are going to show that it is essential to consider time-dependent information such as travel times and changes with respect to the request volume explicitly. Ignoring the current time and its consequences thereafter during the stage of modeling and optimization leads to suboptimal decisions.}

We propose stochastic and robust formulations for the ambulance deployment problem that use data on emergency calls to model uncertainty. By incorporating advances in column and constraint generation, our formulations are solved to exact optimality within minutes. In extensive computational experiments on Washington DC, our approach outperforms previous approaches (i.e. the MEXCLP and MALP) that rely on probabilistic assumptions about the availability of ambulances. Our formulations achieve a reduction of 19 to 28% in number of shortfalls, requiring only 70% of the total number of ambulances required in probabilistic models to attain comparable out-of-sample performance.}

Designating ambulances to serve only infected patients and suspected cases may reduce the outage probabilities of ambulances and consequently the response times of the EMS. We investigate the benefits that EMS personnel and patients can gain from such a split. As a solution method to quantify these benefits, we apply a two-stage approach. First, we run a first-stage optimization model to pre-select ambulance splits with the highest emergency call coverage. Second, we solve the approximate Hypercube Queuing Model (AHQM) to evaluate the performance of the pre-selected ambulance splits at the second stage. We contribute to the existing literature by including multiple incident categories and outages of ambulances in the AHQM and combining it with the first-stage optimization model. Further, we conduct a case study for the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic to draw conclusions on the benefits of splitting. We observe that an ambulance split would not reduce the average response time for the examined data set since the Covid-related call volume in Munich and the infection probability are too low. However, a sensitivity analysis shows that long isolation times and high infection probabilities make an ambulance split beneficial for patients and EMS personnel, as an ambulance split reduces the average response time without significantly increasing the mean infection probability for EMS personnel.}

A reasonable way of deploying the rescue vehicles must be determined given that the times and locations at which the traffic emergencies occur are uncertain. In this paper, we propose a two-stage stochastic programming approach to deploying multiple types of emergency vehicles in response to traffic accidents in the context of uncertainty. The first stage of the proposed model concerns decisions on the quantities of the different types of vehicles to be stocked at each rescue station. In the second stage, when the locations and accident rescue demands are realized in each scenario, the decision-making involves dispatch of the emergency vehicles to the traffic accidents. To solve the proposed model, we suggest a variable neighborhood search method. Using the road network of Jiading District, Shanghai, as an example, we perform numerical experiments to investigate the efficiency of the proposed method and the model validity. Some managerial implications are also outlined in the sensitivity analysis.}

abstract = {Introduction
Demand for emergency ambulances is increasing, therefore it is important that ambulance dispatch is prioritised appropriately. This means accurately identifying which incidents require a lights and sirens (L&S) response and those that do not. For traffic crashes, it can be difficult to identify the needs of patients based on bystander reports during the emergency phone call; as traffic crashes are complex events, often with multiple patients at the same crash with varying medical needs. This study aims to determine how well the text sent to paramedics en-route to the traffic crash scene by the emergency medical dispatcher (EMD), in combination with dispatch codes, can predict the need for a L&S ambulance response to traffic crashes. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from 2014 to 2016 traffic crashes attended by emergency ambulances in Perth, Western Australia. Machine learning algorithms were used to predict the need for a L&S response or not. The features were the Medical Priority Dispatch System (MPDS) determinant codes and EMD text. EMD text was converted for computation using natural language processing (Bag of Words approach). Machine learning algorithms were used to predict the need for a L&S response, defined as where one or more patients (a) died before hospital admission, (b) received L&S transport to hospital, or (c) had one or more high-acuity indicators (based on an a priori list of medications, interventions or observations. Results: There were 11,971 traffic crashes attended by ambulances during the study period, of which 22.3 % were retrospectively determined to have required a L&S response. The model with the highest accuracy was using an Ensemble machine learning algorithm with a score of 0.980 (95 % CI 0.976–0.984). This model predicted the need for an L&S response using both MPDS determinant codes and EMD text. Discussion: We found that a combination of EMD text and MPDS determinate codes can predict which traffic crashes do and do not require a lights and sirens ambulance response to the scene with a high degree of accuracy. Emergency medical services could deploy machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy of dispatch to traffic crashes, which has the potential to result in improved system efficiency.}

abstract = {Objectives. Systematic reviews of the literature assist in the location, appraisal, and synthesis of available evidence. This systematic review aimed to 1) assess the existing literature evaluating the effect of the priority dispatch of emergency ambulances on clinical outcome and ambulance utilization and 2) assess the relative effectiveness of sources of literature relevant to prehospital care. Methods. Systematic review. The quality of each paper was assessed using a standardized seven-point scoring schedule. Sources used were: Medline, the Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Bath Information & Data Services (BIDS), bibliographic searching, contacting researchers active in the field, and hand-searching relevant journals. Key words used were: “ambulance,” “prioritisation,” “dispatch,” and “triage.” Results. Three hundred twenty-six papers were identified: 64 (19.6%) were related to the prioritization of emergency ambulances, and only 20 (6.1%) contained original data. The overall quality of publications was poor, seven (35%) papers having a quality score ≥4. Only half were identified by electronic databases, 55% were identified by people working in the field, and two (10%) were identified by hand-searching (some papers were identified by more than one source). Two high-quality papers support the concept that criteria-based dispatch (CBD) improves clinical outcome; two other papers support CBD's role in improving ambulance utilization. Conclusions. There is very little evidence to support the effect of the prioritization of emergency ambulances on patient outcome. Electronic databases identify only approximately half of all relevant prehospital literature. Future systematic reviews in this area should use electronic databases, supplemented by contact with appropriate experts. PREHOSPITAL EMERGENCY CARE 2002;6:42-49}
