abstract = {This paper introduces a new double standard model (DSM), along with a genetic algorithm (GA), for solving the emergency medical service (EMS) vehicle allocation problem that ensures acceptable service reliability with limited vehicle resources. Without loss of generality, the model is formulated to address emergency services to human injuries caused by vehicle crashes at intersections within an urban street network. The EMS fleet consists of basic life support (BLS) and advanced life support (ALS) vehicles suited for treating crashes with different severity levels within primary and secondary service coverage standards corresponding to extended response times. The model ensures that all demand sites are covered by at least one EMS vehicle within the secondary standard and a portion of which also meets the service reliability requirement. In addition, a portion of demand sites can be covered by at least one of each type of EMS vehicles within the primary standard. Meanwhile, it aims to achieve maximized coverage of demand sites within the primary standard that complies with the required service reliability. A computational experiment is conducted using 2004–2010 data on top two hundred high crash intersections in the city of Chicago as demand sites for model application. With an EMS fleet size of 15 BLS and 60 ALS ambulances maintained by the Chicago Fire Department, at best 92.4–95.5% of demand could be covered within the secondary standard at 90% of service reliability; and 65.5–68.4% of high severity demand and 50.2–54.5 low severity demand could be covered within the primary standard at 90% of service reliability. The model can help optimize EMS vehicle allocation in urban areas.}

abstract = {Travel time is very critical for emergency response and emergency vehicle (EV) operations. Compared to ordinary vehicles (OVs), EVs are permitted to break conventional road rules to reach the destination within shorter time. However, very few previous studies address the travel time performance of EVs. This study obtained nearly 4-year EV travel time data in Northern Virginia (NOVA) region using 76,000 preemption records at signalized intersections. First, the special characteristics of EV travel time are explored in mean, median, standard deviation and also the distribution, which display largely different characteristics from that of OVs in previous studies. Second, a utility-based model is proposed to quantify the travel time performance of EVs. Third, this paper further investigates two important components of the utility model: benchmark travel time and standardized travel time. The mode of the distribution is chosen as benchmark travel time, and its nonlinear decreasing relationship with the link length is revealed. At the same time, the distribution of standardized travel time is fitted with different candidate distributions and Inv. Gaussian distribution is proved to be the most suitable one. Finally, to validate the proposed model, we implement the model in case studies to estimate link and route travel time performance. The results of route comparisons also show that the proposed model can support EV route choice and eventually improve EV service and operations.}

abstract = {Emergency vehicles (EMVs) play a crucial role in responding to time-critical calls such as medical emergencies and fire outbreaks in urban areas. Existing methods for EMV dispatch typically optimize routes based on historical traffic-flow data and design traffic signal pre-emption accordingly; however, we still lack a systematic methodology to address the coupling between EMV routing and traffic signal control. In this paper, we propose EMVLight, a decentralized reinforcement learning (RL) framework for joint dynamic EMV routing and traffic signal pre-emption. We adopt the multi-agent advantage actor–critic method with policy sharing and spatial discounted factor. This framework addresses the coupling between EMV navigation and traffic signal control via an innovative design of multi-class RL agents and a novel pressure-based reward function. The proposed methodology enables EMVLight to learn network-level cooperative traffic signal phasing strategies that not only reduce EMV travel time but also shortens the travel time of non-EMVs. Simulation-based experiments indicate that EMVLight enables up to a 42.6% reduction in EMV travel time as well as an 23.5% shorter average travel time compared with existing approaches.}

abstract = {Emergency vehicle (EV) operation saves lives and reduces property damage. This paper reports two new control strategies for EV signal pre-emption (EVSP) that reduce the response time and minimize the impact of EV operation on general traffic. A real-time control strategy is developed that enables signal transitioning from normal operation to EVSP (transition 1) so that the approaching EV can cross the intersection safely at its operating speed and also the impact of the EVSP on general traffic is decreased. The green time that is not required for the EV is dynamically allotted to the traffic on the cross road by taking into account the prevailing traffic condition at the intersection and the state of signal indication. The second control strategy, implemented by an optimal control algorithm, is used for the signal transitioning from the EVSP back to normal operation (transition 2). A two-phase algorithm, consisting of a relaxation method and a stepwise search strategy, is adopted to overcome the difficulty in solving the optimal control model, which results from the interrelationship between successive signal sequences. Software was developed in the MATLAB environment for simulations of the EVSP process under different signal timing transitioning control strategies. Results indicate that the real-time control and the optimal control strategies and their associated methods perform better than the commonly used existing approaches. It is also demonstrated that the two control strategies are applicable to different traffic conditions up to and slightly over-saturated level, and can be used to deal with a single EVSP occurrence as well as multiple EVSP occurrences.}
