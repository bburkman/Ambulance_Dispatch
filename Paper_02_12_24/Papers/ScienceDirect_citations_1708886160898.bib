Objectives: The aim of this study was to estimate the potential effectiveness of an in-vehicle automatic collision notification (ACN) system in reducing all road crash fatalities in South Australia (SA). Methods: For the years 2008 to 2009, traffic accident reporting system (TARS) data, emergency medical services (EMS) road crash dispatch data, and coroner's reports were matched and examined. This was done to initially determine the extent to which there were differences between the reported time of a fatal road crash in the mass crash data and the time EMS were notified and dispatched. In the subset of fatal crashes where there was a delay, injuries detailed by a forensic pathologist in individual coroner's reports were examined to determine the likelihood of survival had there not been a delay in emergency medical assistance. Results: In 25% (N = 53) of fatalities in SA in the period 2008 to 2009, there was a delay in the notification of the crash event, and hence dispatch of EMS, that exceeded 10 min. In the 2-year crash period, 5 people were likely to have survived through more prompt crash notification enabling quicker emergency medical assistance. Additionally, 3 people potentially would have survived if surgical intervention (or emergency medical assistance to sustain life until surgery) occurred more promptly. Conclusions: The minimum effectiveness rate of an ACN system in SA with full deployment is likely to be in the range of 2.4 to 3.8% of all road crash fatalities involving all vehicle types and all vulnerable road users (pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists) from 2008 to 2009. Considering only passenger vehicle occupants, the benefit is likely to be 2.6 to 4.6%. These fatality reductions could only have been achieved through earlier notification of each crash and their location to enable a quicker medical response. This might be achievable through a fully deployed in-vehicle ACN system.}

abstract = {Background
Advanced Automatic Crash Notification algorithms use vehicle telemetry measurements to predict risk of serious motor vehicle crash injury. The objective of the study was to develop an Advanced Automatic Crash Notification algorithm to reduce response time, increase triage efficiency, and improve patient outcomes by minimizing undertriage (<5%) and overtriage (<50%), as recommended by the American College of Surgeons.
Study Design
A list of injuries associated with a patient's need for Level I/II trauma center treatment known as the Target Injury List was determined using an approach based on 3 facets of injury: severity, time sensitivity, and predictability. Multivariable logistic regression was used to predict an occupant's risk of sustaining an injury on the Target Injury List based on crash severity and restraint factors for occupants in the National Automotive Sampling System - Crashworthiness Data System 2000–2011. The Advanced Automatic Crash Notification algorithm was optimized and evaluated to minimize triage rates, per American College of Surgeons recommendations.
Results
The following rates were achieved: <50% overtriage and <5% undertriage in side impacts and 6% to 16% undertriage in other crash modes. Nationwide implementation of our algorithm is estimated to improve triage decisions for 44% of undertriaged and 38% of overtriaged occupants. Annually, this translates to more appropriate care for >2,700 seriously injured occupants and reduces unnecessary use of trauma center resources for >162,000 minimally injured occupants.
Conclusions
The algorithm could be incorporated into vehicles to inform emergency personnel of recommended motor vehicle crash triage decisions. Lower under- and overtriage was achieved, and nationwide implementation of the algorithm would yield improved triage decision making for an estimated 165,000 occupants annually.}

The estimation of injury severity based on statistical field data, as incorporated in current AACN systems, lack specificity and accuracy to identify the risk of life-threatening conditions. To enhance the existing AACN framework, the goal of the current study was to develop a computational methodology to predict risk of injury in specific body regions based on specific characteristics of the crash, occupant and vehicle. The computational technique involved multibody models of the vehicle and the occupant to simulate the case-specific occupant dynamics and subsequently predict the injury risk using established physical metrics. To demonstrate the computational-based injury prediction methodology, three frontal crash cases involving adult drivers in passenger cars were extracted from the US National Automotive Sampling System Crashworthiness Data System. The representative vehicle model, anthropometrically scaled model of the occupant and kinematic information related to the crash cases, selected at different severities, were used for the blinded verification of injury risk estimations in five different body regions. When compared to existing statistical algorithms, the current computational methodology is a significant improvement toward post-crash injury prediction specifically tailored to individual attributes of the crash. Variations in the initial posture of the driver, analyzed as a pre-crash variable, were shown to have a significant effect on the injury risk.}

Specifically, real-time crash identification using vehicle operation data can enable automotive companies to obtain timely information on the safety of user vehicle usage so that timely customer service and roadside rescue can be provided. In this paper, an accurate vehicle crash identification algorithm is developed based on machine learning techniques using electric vehicles’ operation data provided by SAIC-GM-Wuling. The point of battery disconnection is identified as a potential crash event. Data before and after the battery disconnection is retrieved for feature extraction. Two different feature extraction methods are used: one directly extracts the descriptive statistical features of various variables, and the other directly unfolds the multivariate time series data. The AdaBoost algorithm is used to classify whether a potential crash event is a real crash using the constructed features. Models trained with the two different features are fused for the final outputs. The results show that the final model is simple, effective, and has a fast inference speed. The model has an F1 score of 0.98 on testing data for crash classification, and the identified crash times are all within 10 s around the true crash times.

abstract = {Background
Advanced automatic collision notification (AACN) is a system for predicting occupant injury from collision information. If the helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) physician can be alerted by AACN, it may be possible to reduce the time to patient contact.
Objective
The purpose of this study was to validate the feasibility of early HEMS dispatch via AACN.
Methods
A full-scale validation study was conducted. A car equipped with AACN was made to collide with a wall. Immediately after the collision, the HEMS was alerted directly by the operation center, which received the information from AACN. Elapsed times were recorded and compared with those inferred from the normal, real-world HEMS emergency request process.
Results
AACN information was sent to the operation center only 7 s after the collision; the HEMS was dispatched after 3 min. The helicopter landed at the temporary helipad 18 min later. Finally, medical intervention was started 21 min after the collision. Without AACN, it was estimated that the HEMS would be requested 14 min after the collision by fire department personnel. The start of treatment was estimated to be at 32 min, which was 11 min later than that associated with the use of AACN.
Conclusions
The dispatch of the HEMS using the AACN can shorten the start time of treatment for patients in motor vehicle collisions. This study demonstrated that it is feasible to automatically alert and activate the HEMS via AACN.}

abstract = {Objective
To determine whether occupants of collisions involving at least one vehicle with an available Automatic Collision Notification (ACN) system have quicker times from collision to 1) Emergency Medical Services (EMS) notification and 2) arrival to a medical center.
Methods
Using data from the 2017 Crash Investigation Sampling System, vehicles were categorized as whether ACN was available using data from the CISS's dataset of crash avoidance system availability (in which ACN is included though notably not a crash avoidance system). A Cox proportional hazards model—overall and stratified by urbanization—was used to compare the time from collision to both EMS notification and EMS arrival to a medical center.
Results
A total of 2,034 collisions (weight n: 2,775,512) involving 4235 occupants (weighted n: 4,987,669) were included. An estimated 259,021 (9.3%) and 546,223 occupants (11.0%) were in a collision in which one vehicle had ACN equipped. The median time to EMS notification was longer for collisions in which no involved vehicles had ACN available (median 4, IQR 2-9 minutes) than ACN-exposed collisions (median 2, IQR 1-5 minutes). There was a marginally significant higher hazard (i.e., instantaneous risk) of EMS notification for collisions with at least one vehicle having ACN available (HR 1.77, 95% CI 0.99-3.15). Likewise, there was a higher instantaneous risk of medical center arrival for occupants (HR 1.80, 95% CI 1.41-2.30) involved in collisions in which at least one vehicle had ACN available. ACN was associated with quicker EMS notification only in urban areas (HR 3.06, 95% CI 1.57-5.97) and associated with a greater reduction in time to medical facility in less urban areas (median 36 vs 45 minutes, HR 2.12, 95% CI 1.22-3.63).
Conclusions
This is the first study to directly compare EMS response-related times between collisions involving vehicles with and without ACN available. The current data corroborate prior literature reporting quicker EMS notification times among collisions involving ACN-equipped vehicles. This is the first study to find that ACN is also associated to quicker times to medical center arrival, particularly for collisions occurring in less urban areas. Future research examining whether these decreased times are associated with better clinical outcomes are needed in order to fully assess ACN's ability to prevent trauma-related mortality and morbidity.}

abstract = {Objective: To estimate the reduction in traffic mortality in the United States that would result from an automatic crash notification (ACN) system. Methods: 1997 Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) data from 30875 cases of incapacitating or fatal injury with complete information on emergency medical services (EMS) notification and arrival times were analyzed considering cases at any time to be in one of four states: (1) alive prior to notification; (2) alive after notification; (3) alive after EMS arrival; and (4) dead. For each minute after the crash, transition probabilities were calculated for each possible change of state. These data were used to construct models with (1) number of incapacitating injuries ranging from FARS cases up to an estimated total for the US in 1997; (2) deaths equal to FARS total; (3) transitions to death from other states proportional to FARS totals and rates and (4) other state transitions equal to FARS rates. The outcomes from these models were compared to outcomes from otherwise identical models in which all notification times were set to 1 min. Results: FARS data estimated 12 823 deaths prior to notification, 1800 after notification, and 14 015 between EMS arrival and 6 h. If notification times were all set to 1 min, a model using FARS data only predicted 10 703 deaths prior to notification, 2306 after notification, and 15 208 after EMS arrival, while a model using an estimated total number of incapacitating injuries for the US predicted 9569 deaths prior to notification, 2261 after notification, and 15 134 after arrival. In the first model, overall mortality was reduced from 28 638 to 28 217 (421 per year, or 1.5%), while in the second model mortality was reduced to 26964 (1674 per year, or 6%). Conclusions: Modest but important reduction in traffic mortality should be expected from a fully functional ACN system. Imperfect systems would be less effective.}

Objective: Advanced Automatic Collision Notification (AACN) is a system on a motor vehicle that notifies a public safety answering point (PSAP), either directly or through a third party, that the vehicle has had a crash. AACN systems enable earlier notification of a motor vehicle crash and provide an injury prediction that can help dispatchers and first responders make better decisions about how and where to transport the patient, thus getting the patient to definitive care sooner. The purposes of the current research are to identify the target population that could benefit from AACN, and to develop a reasonable estimate range of potential lives saved with implementation of AACN within the vehicle fleet. Methods: Data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) years 2009–2015 and National Automotive Sampling System–Crashworthiness Data System (NASS-CDS) years 2000–2015 were obtained. FARS data were used to determine absolute estimates of the target population who may receive benefit from AACN. These estimates accounted for a number of factors, such as whether a fatal occupant had nearby access to a trauma center and also was correctly identified by the injury severity prediction algorithm as having a “high probability of severe injury.” NASS-CDS data were used to provide relative comparisons among subsets of the population. Specifically, relative survival rate ratios between occupants treated at trauma centers versus at non-trauma centers were determined using the nonparametric Kaplan–Meier estimator. Finally, the fatality reduction rate associated with trauma center care was combined with the previously published fatality reduction rate for faster notification time to develop a range for possible lives saved. Results: Two relevant target populations were identified. A larger subset of 6893 fatalities can benefit only from earlier notification associated with AACN. A smaller subgroup of between 1495 and 2330 fatalities can benefit from both earlier notification and change in treatment destination (i.e., non-trauma center to trauma center). A Kaplan–Meier life curve and a multiple proportional hazard model were used to predict the benefits associated with transport to a trauma center. The resulting range for potential lives saved annually was 360 to 721. Conclusions: This analysis provides the estimates of lives that could potentially be saved with full implementation of AACN and universal cell coverage availability. This represents a fatality reduction of approximately 1.6% to 3.3% per year, and more than double the lives saved by earlier notification alone. In conclusion, AACN is a postcrash technology with a promising potential for safety benefit. AACN is therefore a key component of integrated safety systems that aim to protect occupants across the entire crash spectrum.}
