abstract = {This paper introduces a new double standard model (DSM), along with a genetic algorithm (GA), for solving the emergency medical service (EMS) vehicle allocation problem that ensures acceptable service reliability with limited vehicle resources. Without loss of generality, the model is formulated to address emergency services to human injuries caused by vehicle crashes at intersections within an urban street network. The EMS fleet consists of basic life support (BLS) and advanced life support (ALS) vehicles suited for treating crashes with different severity levels within primary and secondary service coverage standards corresponding to extended response times. The model ensures that all demand sites are covered by at least one EMS vehicle within the secondary standard and a portion of which also meets the service reliability requirement. In addition, a portion of demand sites can be covered by at least one of each type of EMS vehicles within the primary standard. Meanwhile, it aims to achieve maximized coverage of demand sites within the primary standard that complies with the required service reliability. A computational experiment is conducted using 2004–2010 data on top two hundred high crash intersections in the city of Chicago as demand sites for model application. With an EMS fleet size of 15 BLS and 60 ALS ambulances maintained by the Chicago Fire Department, at best 92.4–95.5% of demand could be covered within the secondary standard at 90% of service reliability; and 65.5–68.4% of high severity demand and 50.2–54.5 low severity demand could be covered within the primary standard at 90% of service reliability. The model can help optimize EMS vehicle allocation in urban areas.}

Compared to ordinary vehicles (OVs), EVs are permitted to break conventional road rules to reach the destination within shorter time. However, very few previous studies address the travel time performance of EVs. This study obtained nearly 4-year EV travel time data in Northern Virginia (NOVA) region using 76,000 preemption records at signalized intersections. First, the special characteristics of EV travel time are explored in mean, median, standard deviation and also the distribution, which display largely different characteristics from that of OVs in previous studies. Second, a utility-based model is proposed to quantify the travel time performance of EVs. Third, this paper further investigates two important components of the utility model: benchmark travel time and standardized travel time. The mode of the distribution is chosen as benchmark travel time, and its nonlinear decreasing relationship with the link length is revealed. At the same time, the distribution of standardized travel time is fitted with different candidate distributions and Inv. Gaussian distribution is proved to be the most suitable one. Finally, to validate the proposed model, we implement the model in case studies to estimate link and route travel time performance. The results of route comparisons also show that the proposed model can support EV route choice and eventually improve EV service and operations.}

Existing methods for EMV dispatch typically optimize routes based on historical traffic-flow data and design traffic signal pre-emption accordingly; however, we still lack a systematic methodology to address the coupling between EMV routing and traffic signal control. In this paper, we propose EMVLight, a decentralized reinforcement learning (RL) framework for joint dynamic EMV routing and traffic signal pre-emption. We adopt the multi-agent advantage actor–critic method with policy sharing and spatial discounted factor. This framework addresses the coupling between EMV navigation and traffic signal control via an innovative design of multi-class RL agents and a novel pressure-based reward function. The proposed methodology enables EMVLight to learn network-level cooperative traffic signal phasing strategies that not only reduce EMV travel time but also shortens the travel time of non-EMVs. Simulation-based experiments indicate that EMVLight enables up to a 42.6% reduction in EMV travel time as well as an 23.5% shorter average travel time compared with existing approaches.}

This paper reports two new control strategies for EV signal pre-emption (EVSP) that reduce the response time and minimize the impact of EV operation on general traffic. A real-time control strategy is developed that enables signal transitioning from normal operation to EVSP (transition 1) so that the approaching EV can cross the intersection safely at its operating speed and also the impact of the EVSP on general traffic is decreased. The green time that is not required for the EV is dynamically allotted to the traffic on the cross road by taking into account the prevailing traffic condition at the intersection and the state of signal indication. The second control strategy, implemented by an optimal control algorithm, is used for the signal transitioning from the EVSP back to normal operation (transition 2). A two-phase algorithm, consisting of a relaxation method and a stepwise search strategy, is adopted to overcome the difficulty in solving the optimal control model, which results from the interrelationship between successive signal sequences. Software was developed in the MATLAB environment for simulations of the EVSP process under different signal timing transitioning control strategies. Results indicate that the real-time control and the optimal control strategies and their associated methods perform better than the commonly used existing approaches. It is also demonstrated that the two control strategies are applicable to different traffic conditions up to and slightly over-saturated level, and can be used to deal with a single EVSP occurrence as well as multiple EVSP occurrences.}

Their objective is to minimize the fraction of arrivals later than a target time. Today, the gap between existing solutions and the optimum is unknown, and we provide a bound for this gap. Motivated by this, we propose a benchmark model (referred to as the offline model) to calculate the optimal dispatch decisions assuming that all incidents are known in advance. For this model, we introduce and implement three different methods to compute the optimal offline dispatch policy for problems with a finite number of incidents. The performance of the offline optimal solution serves as a bound for the performance of an – unknown – optimal online dispatching policy. We show that the competitive ratio (i.e., the worst case performance ratio between the optimal online and the optimal offline solution) of the dispatch problem is infinitely large; that is, even an optimal online dispatch algorithm can perform arbitrarily bad compared to the offline solution. Then, we performed benchmark experiments for a large ambulance provider in the Netherlands. The results show that for this realistic EMS system, when dispatching the closest idle vehicle to every incident, one obtains a fraction of late arrivals that is approximately 2.7 times that of the optimal offline policy. We also analyze another online dispatch heuristic, that manages to reduce this gap to approximately 1.9. This constitutes the first quantification of the gap between online and offline dispatch policies.}

This work considers a joint ambulance location and dispatch problem for a multi-tier ambulance system. The proposed problem addresses three key decisions: the location of ambulance stations, allocation of ambulances to these stations, and the preference order of stations for dispatching ambulances. We consider various other important factors, such as temporal variation in demand and travel time, station-specific ambulance busy probabilities and possible relocation of ambulances over the day. A mixed-integer non-linear programming model is formulated with a survival probability-based objective function to represent the problem. A queueing-based iterative approximation approach is presented to estimate the station-level dispatch probability of ambulances. We propose an adaptive variable neighbourhood search approach to solve the problem that utilises the approximation approach to obtain the objective function. A relaxed station location problem combined with a particle swarm approach for ambulance allocation is solved to obtain an initial solution. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated using a dataset generated based on the city of Kolkata in India.}

After having served a request the vehicle needs to be relocated to its next waiting location. We are going to propose a model and solve the underlying optimization problem using approximate dynamic programming (ADP), an emerging and powerful tool for solving stochastic and dynamic problems typically arising in the field of operations research. Empirical tests based on real data from the city of Vienna indicate that by deviating from the classical dispatching rules the average response time can be decreased from 4.60 to 4.01 minutes, which corresponds to an improvement of 12.89%. Furthermore we are going to show that it is essential to consider time-dependent information such as travel times and changes with respect to the request volume explicitly. Ignoring the current time and its consequences thereafter during the stage of modeling and optimization leads to suboptimal decisions.}

First, we run a first-stage optimization model to pre-select ambulance splits with the highest emergency call coverage. Second, we solve the approximate Hypercube Queuing Model (AHQM) to evaluate the performance of the pre-selected ambulance splits at the second stage. We contribute to the existing literature by including multiple incident categories and outages of ambulances in the AHQM and combining it with the first-stage optimization model. Further, we conduct a case study for the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic to draw conclusions on the benefits of splitting. We observe that an ambulance split would not reduce the average response time for the examined data set since the Covid-related call volume in Munich and the infection probability are too low. However, a sensitivity analysis shows that long isolation times and high infection probabilities make an ambulance split beneficial for patients and EMS personnel, as an ambulance split reduces the average response time without significantly increasing the mean infection probability for EMS personnel.}

abstract = {Introduction
Demand for emergency ambulances is increasing, therefore it is important that ambulance dispatch is prioritised appropriately. This means accurately identifying which incidents require a lights and sirens (L\&S) response and those that do not. For traffic crashes, it can be difficult to identify the needs of patients based on bystander reports during the emergency phone call; as traffic crashes are complex events, often with multiple patients at the same crash with varying medical needs. This study aims to determine how well the text sent to paramedics en-route to the traffic crash scene by the emergency medical dispatcher (EMD), in combination with dispatch codes, can predict the need for a L\&S ambulance response to traffic crashes. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from 2014 to 2016 traffic crashes attended by emergency ambulances in Perth, Western Australia. Machine learning algorithms were used to predict the need for a L\&S response or not. The features were the Medical Priority Dispatch System (MPDS) determinant codes and EMD text. EMD text was converted for computation using natural language processing (Bag of Words approach). Machine learning algorithms were used to predict the need for a L\&S response, defined as where one or more patients (a) died before hospital admission, (b) received L\&S transport to hospital, or (c) had one or more high-acuity indicators (based on an a priori list of medications, interventions or observations. Results: There were 11,971 traffic crashes attended by ambulances during the study period, of which 22.3 % were retrospectively determined to have required a L\&S response. The model with the highest accuracy was using an Ensemble machine learning algorithm with a score of 0.980 (95 % CI 0.976–0.984). This model predicted the need for an L\&S response using both MPDS determinant codes and EMD text. Discussion: We found that a combination of EMD text and MPDS determinate codes can predict which traffic crashes do and do not require a lights and sirens ambulance response to the scene with a high degree of accuracy. Emergency medical services could deploy machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy of dispatch to traffic crashes, which has the potential to result in improved system efficiency.}

The overall quality of publications was poor, seven (35%) papers having a quality score ≥4. Only half were identified by electronic databases, 55% were identified by people working in the field, and two (10%) were identified by hand-searching (some papers were identified by more than one source). Two high-quality papers support the concept that criteria-based dispatch (CBD) improves clinical outcome; two other papers support CBD's role in improving ambulance utilization. Conclusions.

Objectives: The aim of this study was to estimate the potential effectiveness of an in-vehicle automatic collision notification (ACN) system in reducing all road crash fatalities in South Australia (SA). Methods: For the years 2008 to 2009, traffic accident reporting system (TARS) data, emergency medical services (EMS) road crash dispatch data, and coroner's reports were matched and examined. This was done to initially determine the extent to which there were differences between the reported time of a fatal road crash in the mass crash data and the time EMS were notified and dispatched. In the subset of fatal crashes where there was a delay, injuries detailed by a forensic pathologist in individual coroner's reports were examined to determine the likelihood of survival had there not been a delay in emergency medical assistance. Results: In 25% (N = 53) of fatalities in SA in the period 2008 to 2009, there was a delay in the notification of the crash event, and hence dispatch of EMS, that exceeded 10 min. In the 2-year crash period, 5 people were likely to have survived through more prompt crash notification enabling quicker emergency medical assistance. Additionally, 3 people potentially would have survived if surgical intervention (or emergency medical assistance to sustain life until surgery) occurred more promptly. Conclusions: The minimum effectiveness rate of an ACN system in SA with full deployment is likely to be in the range of 2.4 to 3.8% of all road crash fatalities involving all vehicle types and all vulnerable road users (pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists) from 2008 to 2009. Considering only passenger vehicle occupants, the benefit is likely to be 2.6 to 4.6%. These fatality reductions could only have been achieved through earlier notification of each crash and their location to enable a quicker medical response. This might be achievable through a fully deployed in-vehicle ACN system.}

abstract = {Background
Advanced Automatic Crash Notification algorithms use vehicle telemetry measurements to predict risk of serious motor vehicle crash injury. The objective of the study was to develop an Advanced Automatic Crash Notification algorithm to reduce response time, increase triage efficiency, and improve patient outcomes by minimizing undertriage (<5%) and overtriage (<50%), as recommended by the American College of Surgeons.
Study Design
A list of injuries associated with a patient's need for Level I/II trauma center treatment known as the Target Injury List was determined using an approach based on 3 facets of injury: severity, time sensitivity, and predictability. Multivariable logistic regression was used to predict an occupant's risk of sustaining an injury on the Target Injury List based on crash severity and restraint factors for occupants in the National Automotive Sampling System - Crashworthiness Data System 2000–2011. The Advanced Automatic Crash Notification algorithm was optimized and evaluated to minimize triage rates, per American College of Surgeons recommendations.
Results
The following rates were achieved: <50% overtriage and <5% undertriage in side impacts and 6% to 16% undertriage in other crash modes. Nationwide implementation of our algorithm is estimated to improve triage decisions for 44% of undertriaged and 38% of overtriaged occupants. Annually, this translates to more appropriate care for >2,700 seriously injured occupants and reduces unnecessary use of trauma center resources for >162,000 minimally injured occupants.
Conclusions
The algorithm could be incorporated into vehicles to inform emergency personnel of recommended motor vehicle crash triage decisions. Lower under- and overtriage was achieved, and nationwide implementation of the algorithm would yield improved triage decision making for an estimated 165,000 occupants annually.}

The estimation of injury severity based on statistical field data, as incorporated in current AACN systems, lack specificity and accuracy to identify the risk of life-threatening conditions. To enhance the existing AACN framework, the goal of the current study was to develop a computational methodology to predict risk of injury in specific body regions based on specific characteristics of the crash, occupant and vehicle. The computational technique involved multibody models of the vehicle and the occupant to simulate the case-specific occupant dynamics and subsequently predict the injury risk using established physical metrics. To demonstrate the computational-based injury prediction methodology, three frontal crash cases involving adult drivers in passenger cars were extracted from the US National Automotive Sampling System Crashworthiness Data System. The representative vehicle model, anthropometrically scaled model of the occupant and kinematic information related to the crash cases, selected at different severities, were used for the blinded verification of injury risk estimations in five different body regions. When compared to existing statistical algorithms, the current computational methodology is a significant improvement toward post-crash injury prediction specifically tailored to individual attributes of the crash. Variations in the initial posture of the driver, analyzed as a pre-crash variable, were shown to have a significant effect on the injury risk.}

abstract = {Background
Advanced automatic collision notification (AACN) is a system for predicting occupant injury from collision information. If the helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) physician can be alerted by AACN, it may be possible to reduce the time to patient contact.
Objective
The purpose of this study was to validate the feasibility of early HEMS dispatch via AACN.
Methods
A full-scale validation study was conducted. A car equipped with AACN was made to collide with a wall. Immediately after the collision, the HEMS was alerted directly by the operation center, which received the information from AACN. Elapsed times were recorded and compared with those inferred from the normal, real-world HEMS emergency request process.
Results
AACN information was sent to the operation center only 7 s after the collision; the HEMS was dispatched after 3 min. The helicopter landed at the temporary helipad 18 min later. Finally, medical intervention was started 21 min after the collision. Without AACN, it was estimated that the HEMS would be requested 14 min after the collision by fire department personnel. The start of treatment was estimated to be at 32 min, which was 11 min later than that associated with the use of AACN.
Conclusions
The dispatch of the HEMS using the AACN can shorten the start time of treatment for patients in motor vehicle collisions. This study demonstrated that it is feasible to automatically alert and activate the HEMS via AACN.}

abstract = {Objective
To determine whether occupants of collisions involving at least one vehicle with an available Automatic Collision Notification (ACN) system have quicker times from collision to 1) Emergency Medical Services (EMS) notification and 2) arrival to a medical center.
Methods
Using data from the 2017 Crash Investigation Sampling System, vehicles were categorized as whether ACN was available using data from the CISS's dataset of crash avoidance system availability (in which ACN is included though notably not a crash avoidance system). A Cox proportional hazards model—overall and stratified by urbanization—was used to compare the time from collision to both EMS notification and EMS arrival to a medical center.
Results
A total of 2,034 collisions (weight n: 2,775,512) involving 4235 occupants (weighted n: 4,987,669) were included. An estimated 259,021 (9.3%) and 546,223 occupants (11.0%) were in a collision in which one vehicle had ACN equipped. The median time to EMS notification was longer for collisions in which no involved vehicles had ACN available (median 4, IQR 2-9 minutes) than ACN-exposed collisions (median 2, IQR 1-5 minutes). There was a marginally significant higher hazard (i.e., instantaneous risk) of EMS notification for collisions with at least one vehicle having ACN available (HR 1.77, 95% CI 0.99-3.15). Likewise, there was a higher instantaneous risk of medical center arrival for occupants (HR 1.80, 95% CI 1.41-2.30) involved in collisions in which at least one vehicle had ACN available. ACN was associated with quicker EMS notification only in urban areas (HR 3.06, 95% CI 1.57-5.97) and associated with a greater reduction in time to medical facility in less urban areas (median 36 vs 45 minutes, HR 2.12, 95% CI 1.22-3.63).
Conclusions
This is the first study to directly compare EMS response-related times between collisions involving vehicles with and without ACN available. The current data corroborate prior literature reporting quicker EMS notification times among collisions involving ACN-equipped vehicles. This is the first study to find that ACN is also associated to quicker times to medical center arrival, particularly for collisions occurring in less urban areas. Future research examining whether these decreased times are associated with better clinical outcomes are needed in order to fully assess ACN's ability to prevent trauma-related mortality and morbidity.}

abstract = {Objective: To estimate the reduction in traffic mortality in the United States that would result from an automatic crash notification (ACN) system. Methods: 1997 Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) data from 30875 cases of incapacitating or fatal injury with complete information on emergency medical services (EMS) notification and arrival times were analyzed considering cases at any time to be in one of four states: (1) alive prior to notification; (2) alive after notification; (3) alive after EMS arrival; and (4) dead. For each minute after the crash, transition probabilities were calculated for each possible change of state. These data were used to construct models with (1) number of incapacitating injuries ranging from FARS cases up to an estimated total for the US in 1997; (2) deaths equal to FARS total; (3) transitions to death from other states proportional to FARS totals and rates and (4) other state transitions equal to FARS rates. The outcomes from these models were compared to outcomes from otherwise identical models in which all notification times were set to 1 min. Results: FARS data estimated 12 823 deaths prior to notification, 1800 after notification, and 14 015 between EMS arrival and 6 h. If notification times were all set to 1 min, a model using FARS data only predicted 10 703 deaths prior to notification, 2306 after notification, and 15 208 after EMS arrival, while a model using an estimated total number of incapacitating injuries for the US predicted 9569 deaths prior to notification, 2261 after notification, and 15 134 after arrival. In the first model, overall mortality was reduced from 28 638 to 28 217 (421 per year, or 1.5%), while in the second model mortality was reduced to 26964 (1674 per year, or 6%). Conclusions: Modest but important reduction in traffic mortality should be expected from a fully functional ACN system. Imperfect systems would be less effective.}

abstract = {ABSTRACT
Objective: Advanced Automatic Collision Notification (AACN) is a system on a motor vehicle that notifies a public safety answering point (PSAP), either directly or through a third party, that the vehicle has had a crash. AACN systems enable earlier notification of a motor vehicle crash and provide an injury prediction that can help dispatchers and first responders make better decisions about how and where to transport the patient, thus getting the patient to definitive care sooner. The purposes of the current research are to identify the target population that could benefit from AACN, and to develop a reasonable estimate range of potential lives saved with implementation of AACN within the vehicle fleet. Methods: Data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) years 2009–2015 and National Automotive Sampling System–Crashworthiness Data System (NASS-CDS) years 2000–2015 were obtained. FARS data were used to determine absolute estimates of the target population who may receive benefit from AACN. These estimates accounted for a number of factors, such as whether a fatal occupant had nearby access to a trauma center and also was correctly identified by the injury severity prediction algorithm as having a “high probability of severe injury.” NASS-CDS data were used to provide relative comparisons among subsets of the population. Specifically, relative survival rate ratios between occupants treated at trauma centers versus at non-trauma centers were determined using the nonparametric Kaplan–Meier estimator. Finally, the fatality reduction rate associated with trauma center care was combined with the previously published fatality reduction rate for faster notification time to develop a range for possible lives saved. Results: Two relevant target populations were identified. A larger subset of 6893 fatalities can benefit only from earlier notification associated with AACN. A smaller subgroup of between 1495 and 2330 fatalities can benefit from both earlier notification and change in treatment destination (i.e., non-trauma center to trauma center). A Kaplan–Meier life curve and a multiple proportional hazard model were used to predict the benefits associated with transport to a trauma center. The resulting range for potential lives saved annually was 360 to 721. Conclusions: This analysis provides the estimates of lives that could potentially be saved with full implementation of AACN and universal cell coverage availability. This represents a fatality reduction of approximately 1.6% to 3.3% per year, and more than double the lives saved by earlier notification alone. In conclusion, AACN is a postcrash technology with a promising potential for safety benefit. AACN is therefore a key component of integrated safety systems that aim to protect occupants across the entire crash spectrum.}

This paper proposes an efficient automatic accident detection system that attempts to detect the occurrences of the accidents in powered two-wheelers (PTW) automatically using vehicle-dependent parameters and the physiological parameters of the rider in real-time. The proposed system builds an accident detection system in PTW using three steps namely, critical event detection system, accident detection system, and severity assessment system. The critical event detection system reads the accelerometer sensor values from the On-Board Diagnostic (OBD) unit mounted on the PTW and classifies the state of the vehicle as normal, fall-like, and fall through the enhanced decision tree algorithm. The enhanced decision tree algorithm uses a tanh function to calculate entropy values. The rules are extracted to fix the threshold by pruning the decision tree to identify the fall of the vehicle and the rider. Due to the unstable nature of PTW and the rider, a novel Adaptive Sequence Window algorithm (ASW) is proposed to substantiate and validate the occurrence of accidents based on the sequence of states identified. Once the accident is detected, the Decision Support System (DSS) running on the OBD mounted on the PTW decides the severity of the accident by combining the three parameters namely fall of the vehicle, fall of the rider, and pulse rate of the rider using the first-order predicate logic rules.

The OBD unit mounted on the PTW and the rider’s helmet is used to detect the occurrence of accidents automatically along with its severity with less time. The ASW algorithm enables the system to detect the fall of the vehicle and rider within five minutes and prevents false positives.

Based on 3 injury facets (severity; time sensitivity; predictability), a list of Target Injuries associated with a child's need for Level I/II trauma center treatment was determined. Multivariable logistic regression of motor vehicle crash occupants was performed creating the pediatric-specific AACN algorithm to predict risk of sustaining a Target Injury.

Results
The pediatric AACN algorithm achieved 25% to 49% over-triage across crash modes, and under-triage rates of 2% for far-side, 3% for frontal and near-side, 8% for rear, and 14% for rollover crashes. Applied to real-world motor vehicle crashes, improvements of 59% in under-triage and 45% in over-triage are estimated: more appropriate triage of 32,320 pediatric occupants annually.

One major challenge in traffic safety research is the sparsity of crashes, which makes it difficult to achieve a fine-grain understanding of crash causations and predict future crash risk in a timely manner. Hard-braking events have been widely used as a safety surrogate due to their relatively high prevalence and ease of detection with embedded vehicle sensors. As an alternative to using sensors fixed in vehicles, this paper presents a scalable approach for detecting hard-braking events using the kinematics data collected from smartphone sensors. We train a Transformer-based machine learning model for hard-braking event detection using concurrent sensor readings from smartphones and vehicle sensors from drivers who connect their phone to the vehicle while navigating in Google Maps. The detection model shows superior performance with a 0.83 Area under the Precision–Recall Curve (Pr-auc), which is 3.8×better than a Gps speed-based heuristic model, and 166.6×better than an accelerometer-based heuristic model. The detected hard-braking events are strongly correlated with crashes from publicly available datasets, supporting their use as a safety surrogate. In addition, we conduct model fairness and selection bias evaluation to ensure that the safety benefits are equally shared. The developed methodology can benefit many safety applications such as identifying safety hot spots at road network level, evaluating the safety of new user interfaces, as well as using routing to improve traffic safety.}

abstract = {Road crashes are the sixth leading cause of lost disability-adjusted life-years (Dalys) worldwide. One major challenge in traffic safety research is the sparsity of crashes, which makes it difficult to achieve a fine-grain understanding of crash causations and predict future crash risk in a timely manner. Hard-braking events have been widely used as a safety surrogate due to their relatively high prevalence and ease of detection with embedded vehicle sensors. As an alternative to using sensors fixed in vehicles, this paper presents a scalable approach for detecting hard-braking events using the kinematics data collected from smartphone sensors. We train a Transformer-based machine learning model for hard-braking event detection using concurrent sensor readings from smartphones and vehicle sensors from drivers who connect their phone to the vehicle while navigating in Google Maps. The detection model shows superior performance with a 0.83 Area under the Precision–Recall Curve (Pr-auc), which is 3.8×better than a Gps speed-based heuristic model, and 166.6×better than an accelerometer-based heuristic model. The detected hard-braking events are strongly correlated with crashes from publicly available datasets, supporting their use as a safety surrogate. In addition, we conduct model fairness and selection bias evaluation to ensure that the safety benefits are equally shared. The developed methodology can benefit many safety applications such as identifying safety hot spots at road network level, evaluating the safety of new user interfaces, as well as using routing to improve traffic safety.}

abstract = {A multivariate logistic regression model, based upon National Automotive Sampling System Crashworthiness Data System (NASS-CDS) data for calendar years 1999–2008, was developed to predict the probability that a crash-involved vehicle will contain one or more occupants with serious or incapacitating injuries. These vehicles were defined as containing at least one occupant coded with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) of greater than or equal to 15, in planar, non-rollover crash events involving Model Year 2000 and newer cars, light trucks, and vans. The target injury outcome measure was developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-led National Expert Panel on Field Triage in their recent revision of the Field Triage Decision Scheme (American College of Surgeons, 2006). The parameters to be used for crash injury prediction were subsequently specified by the National Expert Panel. Model input parameters included: crash direction (front, left, right, and rear), change in velocity (delta-V), multiple vs. single impacts, belt use, presence of at least one older occupant (≥55 years old), presence of at least one female in the vehicle, and vehicle type (car, pickup truck, van, and sport utility). The model was developed using predictor variables that may be readily available, post-crash, from OnStar®-like telematics systems. Model sensitivity and specificity were 40% and 98%, respectively, using a probability cutpoint of 0.20. The area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve for the final model was 0.84. Delta-V (mph), seat belt use and crash direction were the most important predictors of serious injury. Due to the complexity of factors associated with rollover-related injuries, a separate screening algorithm is needed to model injuries associated with this crash mode.}
