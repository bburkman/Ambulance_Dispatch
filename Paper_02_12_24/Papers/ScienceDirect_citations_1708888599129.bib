abstract = {The two-wheeler accidents in most populated and developing countries have become vulnerable and six accidents happen every hour on average. This paper proposes an efficient automatic accident detection system that attempts to detect the occurrences of the accidents in powered two-wheelers (PTW) automatically using vehicle-dependent parameters and the physiological parameters of the rider in real-time. The proposed system builds an accident detection system in PTW using three steps namely, critical event detection system, accident detection system, and severity assessment system. The critical event detection system reads the accelerometer sensor values from the On-Board Diagnostic (OBD) unit mounted on the PTW and classifies the state of the vehicle as normal, fall-like, and fall through the enhanced decision tree algorithm. The enhanced decision tree algorithm uses a tanh function to calculate entropy values. The rules are extracted to fix the threshold by pruning the decision tree to identify the fall of the vehicle and the rider. Due to the unstable nature of PTW and the rider, a novel Adaptive Sequence Window algorithm (ASW) is proposed to substantiate and validate the occurrence of accidents based on the sequence of states identified. Once the accident is detected, the Decision Support System (DSS) running on the OBD mounted on the PTW decides the severity of the accident by combining the three parameters namely fall of the vehicle, fall of the rider, and pulse rate of the rider using the first-order predicate logic rules. The enhanced decision tree algorithm outperforms the other classifiers such as naïve Bayes, artificial neural network, and recurrent neural network with an accuracy of 99.8%. The OBD unit mounted on the PTW and the rider’s helmet is used to detect the occurrence of accidents automatically along with its severity with less time. The ASW algorithm enables the system to detect the fall of the vehicle and rider within five minutes and prevents false positives. Further, the information can be communicated based on the severity of the accident to the emergency medical service for quick response.}

abstract = {As the automobile market gradually develops towards intelligence, networking, and information-orientated, intelligent identification based on connected vehicle data becomes a key technology. Specifically, real-time crash identification using vehicle operation data can enable automotive companies to obtain timely information on the safety of user vehicle usage so that timely customer service and roadside rescue can be provided. In this paper, an accurate vehicle crash identification algorithm is developed based on machine learning techniques using electric vehicles’ operation data provided by SAIC-GM-Wuling. The point of battery disconnection is identified as a potential crash event. Data before and after the battery disconnection is retrieved for feature extraction. Two different feature extraction methods are used: one directly extracts the descriptive statistical features of various variables, and the other directly unfolds the multivariate time series data. The AdaBoost algorithm is used to classify whether a potential crash event is a real crash using the constructed features. Models trained with the two different features are fused for the final outputs. The results show that the final model is simple, effective, and has a fast inference speed. The model has an F1 score of 0.98 on testing data for crash classification, and the identified crash times are all within 10 s around the true crash times.

abstract = {Background
Advanced automatic crash notification (AACN) can improve triage decision-making by using vehicle telemetry to alert first responders of a motor vehicle crash and estimate an occupant's likelihood of injury. The objective was to develop an AACN algorithm to predict the risk that a pediatric occupant is seriously injured and requires treatment at a Level I or II trauma center.
Methods
Based on 3 injury facets (severity; time sensitivity; predictability), a list of Target Injuries associated with a child's need for Level I/II trauma center treatment was determined. Multivariable logistic regression of motor vehicle crash occupants was performed creating the pediatric-specific AACN algorithm to predict risk of sustaining a Target Injury. Algorithm inputs included: delta-v, rollover quarter-turns, belt status, multiple impacts, airbag deployment, and age. The algorithm was optimized to achieve under-triage ≤5% and over-triage ≤50%. Societal benefits were assessed by comparing correctly triaged motor vehicle crash occupants using the AACN algorithm against real-world decisions.
Results
The pediatric AACN algorithm achieved 25% to 49% over-triage across crash modes, and under-triage rates of 2% for far-side, 3% for frontal and near-side, 8% for rear, and 14% for rollover crashes. Applied to real-world motor vehicle crashes, improvements of 59% in under-triage and 45% in over-triage are estimated: more appropriate triage of 32,320 pediatric occupants annually.
Conclusions
This AACN algorithm accounts for pediatric developmental stage and will aid emergency personnel in correctly triaging pediatric occupants after a motor vehicle crash. Once incorporated into the trauma triage network, it will increase triage efficiency and improve patient outcomes.}

abstract = {Road crashes are the sixth leading cause of lost disability-adjusted life-years (Dalys) worldwide. One major challenge in traffic safety research is the sparsity of crashes, which makes it difficult to achieve a fine-grain understanding of crash causations and predict future crash risk in a timely manner. Hard-braking events have been widely used as a safety surrogate due to their relatively high prevalence and ease of detection with embedded vehicle sensors. As an alternative to using sensors fixed in vehicles, this paper presents a scalable approach for detecting hard-braking events using the kinematics data collected from smartphone sensors. We train a Transformer-based machine learning model for hard-braking event detection using concurrent sensor readings from smartphones and vehicle sensors from drivers who connect their phone to the vehicle while navigating in Google Maps. The detection model shows superior performance with a 0.83 Area under the Precision–Recall Curve (Pr-auc), which is 3.8×better than a Gps speed-based heuristic model, and 166.6×better than an accelerometer-based heuristic model. The detected hard-braking events are strongly correlated with crashes from publicly available datasets, supporting their use as a safety surrogate. In addition, we conduct model fairness and selection bias evaluation to ensure that the safety benefits are equally shared. The developed methodology can benefit many safety applications such as identifying safety hot spots at road network level, evaluating the safety of new user interfaces, as well as using routing to improve traffic safety.}
